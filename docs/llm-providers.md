# LLM Provider Configuration

Sashiko supports multiple LLM providers. This guide covers setup for each
one. Gemini is the default and simplest to configure; the others are
alternatives you can swap in depending on your infrastructure and
preferences.

For all providers, configuration lives in `Settings.toml` at the project
root. Per-provider example files are available in
[docs/examples/](examples/).

## Gemini (default)

The quickest way to get started.

```bash
cp docs/examples/Settings.example.toml Settings.toml
export LLM_API_KEY="your-gemini-api-key"
```

The example file sets `provider = "gemini"` and
`model = "gemini-3.1-pro-preview"`. Adjust the model name as needed.

You can also set any config value via environment variables using the
`SASHIKO` prefix with `__` (double underscore) as the separator:

```bash
export SASHIKO__AI__PROVIDER=gemini
export SASHIKO__AI__MODEL=gemini-3.1-pro-preview
```

## Claude (API)

Uses Anthropic's Claude API directly.

**Get an API key:** https://console.anthropic.com/

**Set credentials:**

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
# Or use the generic fallback:
export LLM_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
```

**Apply the example config:**

```bash
cp docs/examples/Settings.claude.toml Settings.toml
```

**What you get:**

- Automatic prompt caching (5-minute TTL) to reduce costs on repeated context
- Full tool/function calling support for git operations
- Automatic retry on rate limits and API overload
- 200K context window (use `max_input_tokens = 40000` for cost-conscious
  defaults)
- Extended thinking via the `thinking` and `effort` settings in
  `[ai.claude]`

## Claude Code CLI

Uses a local [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) installation as
the completion backend. This uses your Claude Code subscription -- no
per-token charge, no API key.

**Prerequisites:** Install Claude Code and sign in. Verify with
`claude --version`.

**Apply the example config:**

```bash
cp docs/examples/Settings.claude-cli.toml Settings.toml
```

**Model selection:**

`model` accepts any identifier the CLI supports via `--model` -- aliases
like `opus` or `sonnet`, or full names like `claude-opus-4-7`,
`claude-sonnet-4-6`.

Context window sizes:

- `claude-opus-4-7`: 1M tokens by default.
- `claude-sonnet-4-6` and `claude-opus-4-6`: 1M capable, but the CLI
  defaults to 200K. Append `[1m]` (e.g. `claude-sonnet-4-6[1m]`) to
  opt into the 1M variant.
- `claude-haiku-4-5`: 200K only, no 1M variant.
- Pre-thinking models (Claude 3.x) are rejected with HTTP 404.

**What you get:**

- No API key needed -- uses Claude Code's subscription auth.
- Stateless: spawns `claude --print --output-format json` per request.
  No tool access, no file access, no session reuse.
- Prompt caching handled automatically by Claude Code.
- `effort` controls the model's thinking budget. Opus 4.7 uses adaptive
  thinking; Sonnet 4.6 and Haiku 4.5 use extended thinking. If you need
  to pick the mode explicitly or disable thinking, use `provider = "claude"`
  (API) instead.
- `[ai.claude]` settings (`prompt_caching`, `thinking`, etc.) apply only
  to the API provider above -- they are ignored on this path.

**Note:** Each review may spawn many CLI processes. Lower
`review.concurrency` if you hit subscription rate limits.

## GitHub Copilot CLI

Uses a local
[GitHub Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/github-copilot-in-the-cli)
installation as the completion backend. This uses your GitHub Copilot
subscription -- no per-token charge, no API key.

**Prerequisites:**

- `copilot` CLI installed and on `$PATH`
- Authenticated session (run `copilot` once interactively to log in)

**Apply the example config:**

```bash
cp docs/examples/Settings.copilot-cli.toml Settings.toml
```

**What you get:**

- `model` follows GitHub Copilot's catalog (e.g. `claude-sonnet-4.5`,
  `gpt-5.5`); pick a model your subscription has access to.
- Sashiko invokes `copilot` with `--disable-builtin-mcps`,
  `--no-custom-instructions`, and `--allow-all-tools` so it acts as a
  pure text-completion-with-tools backend.
- The prompt is sent via stdin (not `-p`) to avoid Linux's
  `MAX_ARG_STRLEN` cap (~128 KB per argv element).
- `max_interactions` controls tool-call rounds before aborting.

**Note:** Each review may spawn many `copilot` processes. Lower
`review.concurrency` if you hit subscription rate limits.

## AWS Bedrock

Uses AWS Bedrock via the Converse API. Works with any Bedrock-hosted
model (Claude, Llama, Mistral, etc.). Requires building with
`--features bedrock`.

**Prerequisites:** Enable model access in the
[AWS Bedrock console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) for your
desired model and region.

**Set AWS credentials** using any standard method:

```bash
# Option 1: Environment variables
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="..."
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="..."
export AWS_REGION="us-east-1"

# Option 2: AWS CLI profile (~/.aws/credentials)
aws configure
```

**Apply the example config:**

```bash
cp docs/examples/Settings.claude-bedrock.toml Settings.toml
```

**What you get:**

- Converse API -- works with any Bedrock-hosted model
- No API key needed -- uses standard AWS IAM authentication
- Cross-region inference profiles (e.g. `us.anthropic.claude-*`)
- Full tool/function calling support

## Google Cloud Vertex AI

Uses Claude and Gemini models via Google Cloud infrastructure. Requires
building with `--features vertex`.

**Prerequisites:** Enable the Vertex AI API and model access in the
[Vertex AI Model Garden](https://cloud.google.com/model-garden).

**Authenticate:**

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

**Set project and region:**

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID="my-gcp-project"  # Or GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT
export CLOUD_ML_REGION="us-east5"                    # Or GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION
```

`[ai.vertex]` in `Settings.toml` outranks all four.

**Apply the example config:**

```bash
cp docs/examples/Settings.claude-vertex.toml Settings.toml   # Claude
cp docs/examples/Settings.gemini-vertex.toml Settings.toml   # Gemini
```

**What you get:**

- No API key needed -- uses Google Cloud Application Default Credentials
- Global, multi-region, and regional endpoint support
- 1M context window for Claude Opus 4.7/4.6 and Sonnet 4.6 on Vertex, and
  for Gemini
- Full tool/function calling support

**Model selection:**

`model` selects the wire format: a `claude-` name goes to Anthropic's
`rawPredict` endpoint, a `gemini-` name to Google's `generateContent`.
Anything else is rejected at startup.

`prompt_caching`, `max_tokens`, `thinking` and `effort` under `[ai.vertex]`
apply to the Claude path only.

## Kiro CLI

Uses the local `kiro-cli` as a completion backend.

**Prerequisites:** Install `kiro-cli` and authenticate with
`KIRO_API_KEY` or a browser login.

**Apply the example config:**

```bash
cp docs/examples/Settings.kiro-cli.toml Settings.toml
```

**What you get:**

- Runs `kiro-cli acp` as a stateless completion backend
- Kiro native tools are disabled by default; Sashiko's own tool protocol
  is used instead
- An isolated temporary agent with a deny-all hook prevents accidental
  tool execution

## goose

Uses [goose](https://goose-docs.ai/) as the completion backend.
goose speaks the Agent Client Protocol on stdio, and it fronts any backend
goose itself supports, which makes this the shortest path to a fully local
review: goose in front of a vLLM or Ollama server.

Like Sashiko, goose is a Linux Foundation project -- it sits under the
[Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF)](https://aaif.io/).

**Prerequisites:** Install `goose` and make sure the backend it points at is
reachable.

**Apply the example config:**

```bash
cp docs/examples/Settings.goose-cli.toml Settings.toml
```

**What you get:**

- Runs `goose acp` as a stateless completion backend
- Each request gets a throwaway `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` whose `config.yaml` pins
  goose to chat mode, so goose never runs a tool of its own and Sashiko's
  tool protocol stays the only tool layer
- The throwaway config also keeps the user's own goose configuration and
  extensions out of a review
- `XDG_DATA_HOME` and `XDG_STATE_HOME` are redirected alongside it, so the
  session database and the logs goose writes per request are discarded with
  the request instead of accumulating in the user's home directory, and
  concurrent reviews never share one session database
- Token usage is taken from goose's own `session/prompt` accounting rather
  than estimated

**Pointing goose at a local model:**

```toml
[ai]
provider = "goose"
model = "qwen3-8b-ov"

[ai.goose_cli]
goose_provider = "openai"
context_window_size = 32768

[ai.goose_cli.env]
OPENAI_HOST = "http://localhost:8000"
OPENAI_BASE_PATH = "v1/chat/completions"
OPENAI_API_KEY = "dummy"
```

`goose_provider` accepts any goose provider id (`openai`, `ollama`,
`anthropic`, `google`, ...). The `[ai.goose_cli.env]` table is passed to the
goose child process; goose inherits Sashiko's environment, so exported
variables work too and the table overrides them. Keep real API keys in
the environment rather than in the settings file.

The table cannot override the variables that make goose a completion
backend. `GOOSE_MODE`, the three XDG directories and the model and provider
taken from `[ai]` are pinned after it, so a stray entry cannot hand goose
back its own tools, its own session history or the user's own
configuration.

goose prepends its own system prompt and platform tool schemas to every
request, which costs roughly 5k tokens before Sashiko's prompt is even
counted. Set `max_input_tokens` well below `context_window_size` so a review
prompt plus that overhead still fits.

## Codex CLI

Uses a local [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) (OpenAI)
installation as the completion backend. This uses your Codex
subscription -- no per-token charge, no API key.

**Prerequisites:** Install the `codex` CLI and authenticate.

**Apply the example config:**

```bash
cp docs/examples/Settings.codex-cli.toml Settings.toml
```

For OpenAI's coding-optimized model, use
`docs/examples/Settings.gpt-5-codex.toml` instead (same backend,
`model = "gpt-5-codex"`).

**What you get:**

- Runs `codex exec --json --sandbox read-only` as a stateless backend
- Prompt sent via stdin to avoid `ARG_MAX` issues
- No tool access -- sandbox is read-only

**Reasoning effort:**

```toml
[ai.codex_cli]
effort = "xhigh"    # "none", "minimal", "low", "medium", "high", "xhigh", "max"
```

Sashiko passes this as `codex exec -c model_reasoning_effort=<effort>`,
so the setting applies only to a reasoning model such as `gpt-5-codex`.
A `-c` override outranks `~/.codex/config.toml`. It does not outrank an
enterprise-managed requirements layer, which substitutes its own value
whatever the origin. A run whose effort that layer substitutes fails
rather than record a review at an effort other than the one configured.
Leave the setting unset to accept the account default.

#### Devin CLI Setup

Sashiko can use a local [Devin for Terminal](https://cli.devin.ai/) install as
a completion backend. This path uses your Devin subscription, so there is no
per-token API charge and no API key to configure.

**Prerequisites**:
- `devin` CLI installed and on `$PATH`
- Authenticated session (run `devin auth login` once)

**Update Settings.toml**:
Copy `examples/Settings.devin-cli.toml` to your `Settings.toml` and adjust as needed.

**Notes**:
- `model` accepts any identifier `devin --model` accepts (e.g. `opus`,
  `swe`, `gpt`, `codex`). Leave it empty in `[ai]` to use the Devin default.
- Sashiko invokes `devin --print --prompt-file <tmp>`
  per request. The prompt is written to a temp file which is passed to `devin`.
- Each review may spawn many `devin` processes. Lower `review.concurrency`
  if you hit subscription rate limits.

## Ollama

[Ollama](https://ollama.com/) allows running LLMs locally.

**Prerequisites:** Install Ollama and pull your desired model (e.g., `ollama pull deepseek-v3`).

**Apply the example config:**

```bash
cp docs/examples/Settings.ollama.toml Settings.toml
```

**What you get:**

- Private, local execution of LLMs
- Support for reasoning models via the `think` setting
- No API key or subscription required
- `context_window_size` maps to Ollama's `num_ctx`

## vLLM

[vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/) serves local models behind an
OpenAI-compatible API.

**Prerequisites:** Start a vLLM server, e.g.:

```bash
vllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-8B --max-model-len 32768 --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

**Apply the example config:**

```bash
cp docs/examples/Settings.vllm.toml Settings.toml
```

**What you get:**

- Private, local execution of LLMs
- Reasoning model support: `<think>` blocks and `reasoning_content` are
  separated from the answer automatically, and thinking can be toggled via
  the `enable_thinking` setting
- Leaving `max_tokens` unset lets vLLM generate up to the remaining context,
  which is useful for servers running with a small `--max-model-len`
- Optional `guided_json` setting to enforce JSON responses through guided
  decoding on backends that support it
- Optional `enable_tools` setting to forward tool definitions; requires a
  server started with `--enable-auto-tool-choice` and `--tool-call-parser`
- If the server was started with `--api-key`, export it as `VLLM_API_KEY`
  (or `LLM_API_KEY`)

Set `context_window_size` to match the server's `--max-model-len`.

## OpenAI-Compatible Providers

Sashiko includes an OpenAI-compatible provider for endpoints that
implement the OpenAI chat completions API.

**Apply the example config:**

```bash
cp docs/examples/Settings.openai-compat.toml Settings.toml
```

Adjust `base_url` to point to your provider's endpoint.

`base_url` may be either:

- a shorthand such as `http://localhost:8080/v1` (the `/chat/completions`
  suffix is appended automatically), or
- the full chat completions URL, e.g.
  `https://api.z.ai/api/coding/paas/v4/chat/completions`. Use this form for
  providers whose path is not a recognised shorthand.

**Provider routing (OpenRouter):**

OpenRouter accepts a `provider` object in the request body to control
routing. Sashiko exposes an ordered subset of it via
`[ai.openai_compat]`:

```toml
[ai.openai_compat]
base_url = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
# Try these providers in order (slugs as shown on the OpenRouter model page).
provider_order = ["deepseek", "deepinfra"]
# Optional. false restricts routing to the ordered list (fail instead of
# falling back); the default true keeps other providers as fallbacks.
allow_fallbacks = false
```

Setting `provider_order` disables OpenRouter's price-based load balancing.
Slug shortcuts on the model id (`:floor`, `:nitro`) remain an alternative for
sort-by-price / sort-by-throughput. Endpoints that do not implement the
`provider` field ignore it.

**z.ai / Zhipu (glm-*) example:**

z.ai exposes two OpenAI-compatible gateways with **separate billing**: a
direct API (`…/api/paas/v4/…`, billed to the API resource package) and a
coding-plan gateway (`…/api/coding/paas/v4/…`, billed to the coding-plan
subscription). To review against the coding-plan quota, point `base_url` at
the full coding endpoint and set `LLM_API_KEY` (or `OPENAI_API_KEY`):

```toml
[ai]
provider = "openai-compatible"
model = "glm-5.2"

[ai.openai_compat]
base_url = "https://api.z.ai/api/coding/paas/v4/chat/completions"
context_window_size = 128000
max_tokens = 16384
```

**OrcaRouter example:**

[OrcaRouter](https://www.orcarouter.ai) is an OpenAI-compatible gateway to
models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and other providers behind a single
endpoint and API key. Point `base_url` at `https://api.orcarouter.ai/v1` and
use a namespaced model id such as `openai/gpt-4o-mini`:

```toml
[ai]
provider = "openai-compatible"
model = "openai/gpt-4o-mini"

[ai.openai_compat]
base_url = "https://api.orcarouter.ai/v1"
context_window_size = 128000
max_tokens = 16384
```

For OpenAI's own API with an API key (rather than a self-hosted
compatible endpoint), use `docs/examples/Settings.openai-api.toml`:
set `provider = "openai"`, `model = "gpt-5.6-sol"`, and export
`OPENAI_API_KEY`.

Some compatible gateways reject the `temperature` field for reasoning
models. Sashiko retries an explicit unsupported-temperature error without
the field and omits it on later requests to the same endpoint.
